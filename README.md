# rn-manager

This is my first React Native App. This app will make it easier for organizations to manage their instructors or teachers absences. This way the manager can plan more effectively for substitutes and report problems.

This app will use:

``` 
- React Native

- Native Base

- Redux

- React Navigation

- Prettier

- Husky

- Jest (unit testing and snapshots only)
```
