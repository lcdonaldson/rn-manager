# rn-manager

** This project will be sunset for a about a year and then removed. As the ecosystem of react native has changed so much, it's not worth upkeeping or trying to fix. Its better to just start new. 


If I remove it though it will undo all the progress for the days I worked on it and wreck my commit streak so I will have it just sit or even move to private after march 2021, Then delete after a year. **

The idea for this project came from a tutorial on udemy and I have modified it a little bit.

While the development can and will change as it unfolds,

the plan at this time is to use the following:

Current project is broken in this state. Needs upgrading to continue. This will result in sunsetting this repo and starting over.
``` 
- React Native

- Component Libraries

- State management

- Stack and Drawer Navigation

- Prettier

- Husky

- Unit Testing
```
Changes coming summer 2021
