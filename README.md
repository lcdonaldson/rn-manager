# rn-manager

The idea for this project comes from a tutorial on udemy and I have modified it a little bit.

While the development can and will change as it unfolds,
The plan at this time is to use the following:

Current project is broken in this state. Needs upgrading to continue
``` 
- React Native

- Component Libraries

- State management

- Stack and Drawer Navigation

- Prettier

- Husky

- Unit Testing
```
